# Tiny-Serial
A small â‰ˆ100 loc serial monitor
# Compiling
I've only tested this on linux and mac, it doesnt require any dependencies besides the c standard library and linux headers.
```
make
make install
```
# Running
The program requires a a path to the tty device as well as optionally a baudrate (it defaults to 9600)
